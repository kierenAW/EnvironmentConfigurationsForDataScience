# Conda Environments

## How do I add my own changes to an environment?
Once created and published we consider environments to be immutable. When making any alterations or additions please submit the new environment via a pull request with the new environment numbered sequentially from the highest number environment below.

## I'm new here where do I start?
The answer depends on what you want to achieve and what packages you need so below are some examples and ideas of where to start, most environments contain Jupyter, pandas and numpy 

#### I want to do some analysis and maybe dabble with running deep learning [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "inferences") using  [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/, "Tensorflow")
[E011] can be a great place to start, it contains a great selection of packages and is currently being used successfully to deliver some great analytics in a corporate context. Strongly consider starting here unless you know you need more.

#### I want to do get serious about deep learning with [PyTorch]("https://pytorch.org/")/[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/, "Tensorflow") and my GPU needs something to do
[E015] contains a great list of packages and doesn't constrain versions so you will get the latest that conda provide. Beware of compatibility issues from versions changing.

### I need FastAI and PyTorch
[E015] might be the answer to your need

### I want to use TensorFlow 2
[E016] contains TF2 and other useful packages

#### I really need TensorFlow 1.6 and Python 3.6 with open CV
[E006] provides this exact environment and was used for [DeepLab]("https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab") training 

#### I need R to do my analytics
This is still not implemented

## More info
Each environment is created sequentially numbered to allow for versioning and easy tracking.

e.g. <i>Enviroment 001</i> which gets called <i>E001</i>  

Most of the environments are created by importing a previous environment and updating and adding additional packages. 

## YML Files

The YML files are named as per the environment name followed by the operating system (eg windows) or "generic" if OS specific packages have been removed and the packages should work on both windows and Linux.

## Useful commands

#### Create a Conda Enviroment with default imports:
<i>conda create --name [env]</i>

#### Create a enviroment from a yml file
<i>conda env create -f [filename].yml</i>

#### Clone an existing conda environment
<i>conda create --name <new_env> --clone <existing_env></i>

#### Update all packages in an enviroment
<i>conda update --all</i>

#### Export YML from an existing enviroment
<i>conda env export -n [venv] > [filename].yml</i>

#### Remove  an existing conda environment
<i>conda env remove -n [venv]</i>

#### List all discoverable environments:
<i>conda info --envs</i>

#### More information can be found at

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

## Windows to Linux Diffrences 

#### Regex to find the hashes at the end of the yml files:
=[A-Z]+.*$

Removing the hashes from a yml file aids the imports into Linux where the compiled hash values are different.

#### The following packages appear to be windows specific:
- msys2-conda-epoch - https://www.msys2.org/
- m2w64* including:
	* m2w64-gcc-libgfortran
	* m2w64-libwinpthread-git
	* m2w64-gcc-libs
	* m2w64-libwinpthread-git
	* m2w64-gmp
	* m2w64-gcc-libs-core
